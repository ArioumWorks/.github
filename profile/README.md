## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who are we?
We at ArioumWorks are solution driven individuals who are determined to build the next big thing. We focus on building apps that are actually useful for daily users. We are planning to go Open Source once we have enough apps under our belt.


## How can I contribute?
Unfortunately, not yet! We are still amidst brainstorming ideas for the flagship application and for relative tools to be used to build it. We are currently allowing a few individuals to contribute to this project. Rest assured we'll let you know once we are accepting contributors to our projects.


## What is the end goal?
To build a ecosystem around our apps and to truly experience the connectivity between all the apps across multiple devices.
